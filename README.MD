# loot-options
Commands to change loot options.

## Commands
### `loots roll`
- Round robin with rolling (Default)

### `loots random`
- Round robin with random distribution

### `loots ffa`
- Free-for-All

## Info
You can start a vote even if you are not party leader, but it will fail because the party leader does not get an option to accept. (The party leader would need a module that hooks S_PARTY_LOOTING_METHOD_VOTE and leader set to false to get an option)
